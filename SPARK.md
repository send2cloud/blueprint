# Spark & North Star

## Spark
Blueprint exists so the creator can capture the original spark behind a project and keep that context alive over time. It is a private, project‑local idea room for notes, sketches, flows, tasks, and artifacts.

## North Star
Blueprint should be:
- **Portable**: It travels with the repo and stays useful months or years later.
- **Installable**: It can be dropped into any new project with minimal setup.
- **Detachable**: It does not couple to the host app’s logic. It is a companion, not a dependency.

## Success Checks
- New project → install Blueprint → capture spark in minutes.
- Artifacts remain with the project and are still readable a year later.
- Easy to share links back to an LLM or teammate for context.

## Non‑Goals
- Blueprint does not need to ship with the public product.
- Blueprint does not need deep integration with app business logic.
